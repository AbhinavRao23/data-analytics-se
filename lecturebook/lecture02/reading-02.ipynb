    "## Logical sentences\n",
    "A logical sentence is a statement about the world that can be true or false.\n",
    "Science makes such statements all the time.\n",
    "For example, \"the circumference of the Earth is 40,075 km (plus or minus 1 km)\" is a logical sentence.\n",
    "We will not go any deeper into the formal definition of logical sentences.\n",
    "But we will require that the set of logical sentences we are working with is *consistent*.\n",
    "That is, it does not contain contradictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will denote logical sentences with capital letters: $A$, $B$, $C$, etc.\n",
    "We form new logical sentences from old ones using the following logical connectives:\n",
    "+ $\\text{not}\\;A \\equiv \\neg A$: the logical sentence that is true when $A$ is false and false when $A$ is true.\n",
    "+ $A\\;\\text{and}\\;B \\equiv A, B \\equiv AB$: the logical sentence that is true when $A$ and $B$ are true and false otherwise.\n",
    "+ $A\\;\\text{or}\\;B \\equiv A+B$: the logical sentence that is true when $A$ or $B$ are true and false otherwise.\n",

    "(probability-as-a-representation-of-our-state-of-knowledge)=\n",
    "## Probability as a representation of our state of knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call $I$ the logical sentence containing all *information* you have now.\n",
    "And I am talking about absolutely everything: \n",
    "+ What your parents taught you,\n",
    "+ What you learned in school, what you learned in college,\n",
    "+ What your eyes see right now on some scientific instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a logical sentence $A$ that says something about the world.\n",
    "For example, $A$ could be \"The result of the next coin toss John performs will be heads.\"\n",
    "Or anything.\n",
    "We are uncertain about $A$.\n",
    "We do not know if it is true or false.\n",
    "We could use the information $ I $ to say something more about $ A $.\n",
    "Maybe we believe that it is more likely that $A$ is true than false.\n",
    "Maybe the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is about this problem.\n",
    "It gives us a number $p(A|I)$.\n",
    "We read $p(A|I)$ as \"the probability that $A$ is true given that we know $I$.\"\n",
    "It quantifies our degree of belief that $A$ is true given that we know $I$.\n",
    "We say that $p(A|I)$ represents our knowledge about $A$ given $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But what about frequencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "In introductory courses to probability or statistics, we usually learn that the probability of an event is the frequency with which it occurs in nature.\n",
    "This interpretation is valid if the event is something that indeed occurs repeatedly.\n",
    "However, it is pretty restrictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, what can we say about an event that can happen only once?\n",
    "For example, what is the probability that life on Earth will end in a billion years?\n",
    "It is not possible to repeat this experiment.\n",
    "It is not even possible to observe its outcome.\n",
    "The frequency interpretation of probability is not applicable.\n",
    "However, we would like to use probability to quantify our degree of belief that life on Earth will end in a billion years.\n",
    "It makes intuitive sense that we can do this.\n",
    "We want to do this.\n",
    "Scientists and engineers think like this all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is our approach compatible with the frequency interpretation?\n",
    "It can be shown, see {cite}`jaynes03` for the proof, that our approach is indeed compatible with the frequency interpretation.\n",
    "That is, when events occur repeatedly, then the probabilities do become frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The common sense assumptions that give rise to the basic probability rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation. Pierre-Simon Laplace, Théorie analytique des probabilités (1814)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following three ingredients:\n",
    "+ A: a logical sentence\n",
    "+ B: another logical sentence\n",
    "+ I: all the information we know\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try to make a robot that can argue under uncertainty.\n",
    "It should be able to take logical sentences (such as $A$ and $B$ above) and argue about them using all its information.\n",
    "What sort of system should govern this robot?\n",
    "The following desiderata, see {cite:p}`jaynes03`, seem reasonable:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Real numbers represent degrees of plausibility.\n",
    "+ The system should have a qualitative correspondence to common sense.\n",
    "+ The system should be consistence in the sense that:\n",
    " - If there are two ways to calculate a degree of plausibility, each way must lead to the same result.\n",
    " - The robot should take into account all evidence relevant to a question.\n",
    " - Equivalent plausibility assignments must represent equivalent states of knowledge.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "> The desiderata are enough to derive the rules of probability theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Talking about probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "We read $p(A|BI)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ the probability of $A$ being true given that we know that $B$ and $I$ are true; or\n",
    "+ the probability of $A$ being true given that we know that $B$ is true; or\n",
    "+ the probability of $A$ given $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $p(A|BI)$ is a number between 0 and 1, quantifying the degree of plausibility that $A$ is true given $B$ and $I$.\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = 1$ when we are certain that $A$ is true if $B$ is true (and I).\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = 0$ when we are certain that $A$ is false if $B$ is true (and $I$).\n",
    "+ $0< p(A|B,I) < 1$ when we are uncertain about $A$ if $B$ is true (and $I$).\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = \\frac{1}{2}$ when we are completely ignorant about $A$ if $B$ is true (and $I$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The rules of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in probability theory derives from two rules.\n",
    "These are direct consequences of the desiderata and Cox's theorem.\n",
    "They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The **obvious rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A|I) + p(\\neg A|I) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule states that $A$ or its negation must be true.\n",
    "We see why it is vitally important that you refrain from applying probability in a system that includes contradictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The **product rule** (or Bayes' rule or Bayes' theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A,B|I) = p(A|B,I)p(B|I).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule states that the probability of $A$ and $B$ is the probability of $A$ given that $B$ is true times the probability that $B$ is true.\n",
    "Even though the correspondence is not one-to-one, visualizing events using the Venn diagrams helps in understanding the product rule:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure-md} venn\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/venn.png\">\n",
    "\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram:\n",
    "+ $p(A,B|I)$ corresponds to the brown area (normalized by the area of I).\n",
    "+ $p(B|I)$ is the area of $B$ (normalized by the area of $I$).\n",
    "+ $p(A|BI)$ is the brown area (normalized by the area of $B$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the product rule takes some time.\n",
    "But it is worth it, as it tells us how to update our knowledge as we gather new information.\n",
